    Hi, Welcome to my page! I'm Lily Yao, sometimes I also go by cirrus or llylithe, and I'm a highschool student from Australia.
    I'm trying to get into cybersec, and have competed in a few CTFs (always down if ur interested!), mostly within OSINT, cryptography, and web exploitation categories. I also enjoy playing around with front-end development, and know html, css, and a tad of javascript. I'm still quite new to this so lmk if u have any ideas on what i should put here cause it is kinda empty and lwk sad.
    <br><br>
    Other than this, my hobbies mostly lie within art (mostly digital with clip studio paint), piano and flute, and i love collecting things :D (mostly albums + figures). I also spend a ridiculous amount of time playing games. I'm a huge fan of psychological horror (omori and mouthwashing), just general horror (resident evil), rhythm games (arcaea, musedash, phigros, and pjsk (before i got a new phone and lost my account :(( )), and I love physical board and card games (hence the theme of this website). I also love music, and waste potentially even more time making playlists than I do playing games.
